This project demonstrate a working CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, K8s on AWS. When you make a commit, pipeline checks for lint, create a docker image, push it to dockerhub, setup aws infrastructure, install k8s, and deploy the app with 2 replica set, and forward the port for public access.

To run this you will need to setup jenkins box, ansible, and cofigure credentials in jenkins ( aws/ ssh)
